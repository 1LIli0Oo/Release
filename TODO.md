## GacUI 1.0

- [ ] Cannot change column size during datagrid's bounds changing, which is by designed and this could be solved by calling InvokeInMainThread. But new feature for solving this is under considering
  - [ ] Considering GuiBindableDataGrid updating columns' sizes according to configuration automatically, and call `GuiControl::InvokeOrDelayIfRendering` (indirectly) inside `DataColumn::NotifyAllColumnsUpdate` when necessary.
  - [ ] Like a table, a column can use `Absolute`, `Draggable` and `Percentage` to specify a column size. Only when a column is draggable, users can use their mouse to change the size of a column, and then trigger `IColumnItemView::SetColumnSize`
- [ ] Consider drag and drop support, with column drag and drop
- [ ] New item arranger that can accept a `GuiRepeatCompositionBase`
- [ ] `let X = Y in (F(X.a.b.c))` reports `X does not exist in the current scope` in binding property value
  - while `F((let X = Y.a.b).c)` works
- [ ] **Update Release**
- [ ] New default control templates with animation, written in XML generated C++ code.
- [ ] A window can be called to update all its controls' and components' template
- [ ] Tutorials use the new default control templates
- [ ] **Update Release**
- [ ] Fix GacGen reports only "error dumping resource file" while the resource file contains some syntax errors preventing GacGen from reading it
  - Unable to repro

**ON GOING**: Document repo

## GacUI 2.0

### Vlpp

- Regex supports UTF-16 (instead of UCS-2) on MSVC.
  - Always convert to UTF-32 internally (**`vl::regex::Utf32Reader`**).
- Redesign vl::parsing.
  - No need to specify ambiguity
  - Will print all ambiguous cases and marked AST node
  - ToString with hints and custom options
  - Print diff when updating AST (for IDE)
  - All existing features and backward compatible interface design
- Binary ITypeDescriptor provider format.
- API to import and export fake types (ITypeDescriptor that cannot be executed)
- Interfaces for collections types like `IReadableCollection<T>`
  - or `IReadOnlyCollection`, `IWriteOnlyCollection`, `ICollection`
  - `Slice`, `Contact` functions on interfaces
- Reflectable interfaces like `IReflectableReadableCollection<T>`, inherits from `IReadableCollection<T>` and `IReadableCollection<Value>`
- Remove `FOREACH` and `FOREACH_INDEXER`, replaced by range-based for loop
- Fix `Linq` so that lambda parameters can be `auto`, instead of specified `types`

### Workflow

- Don't create IValueList if apply `{1 2 3}` on `List<int>` argument.
- Support `<category>name` identifier, make generated code re-parsable.
- Recognize collection interfaces instead of collection entities.
  - Reconsider how to implement collection creating code in Workflow.
- Move to new ParserGen.
- WorkflowCompiler.exe (x32/x64)
  - Enable external symbols
  - Compile
  - Binary Output (full assembly or types only)
  - C++ Codegen (x32/x64)
- (probably not do)
  - Macro
  - Context-Grammar Sensitive Macro
  - Virtual function
  - Class implements interface

## GacUI

### Before 1.0 (Optional)

- `<eval Ref="Name"/>` and `<eval Eval="expression"/>` tags
- Enable Workflow script template for IGuiInstanceLoader written in text
- INativeImage::SaveToStream handle correctly for git format. It is possible that LoadFromStream need to process diff between git raw frames.

### After 1.0

- Use collection interfaces on function signatures.
- Move to new ParserGen.

### Cross Platforms

- Ncurses on Ubuntu
- macOS
- Web Assembly

### Graphics

- MetaImageElement and MetaImage data structure
- Remove PolygonElement
- Default non-text element renderer using MetaImageElement
- Replacing GDI and D2D non-text element renderers
- Meta3DElement and Meta3D data structure
- Default Meta3DElement renderer using MetaImageElement with a surface sorting based algorithm

### Controls

- Chart
- Dock Container
- Touch support

### Binders

- Other languages
  - XML still generate C++ files, and they need to be compiled to an appropriate form.
  - Other programming languages doesn't access GacUI objects, instead they implement view model interfaces that defined in XML.
  - Users need to compile C++ code by themselves.
  - Users are not required to write C++ code, but they can.
  - Users can add attributes in XML defined interfaces, so that GacGen can generate a list of them. After that, by reading generated workflow assembly files, glue code can be generated so that users can implement required view model interfaces directly. I will provide some tools for listed languages.
  - Resources need to be generated in C++ files, because other languages cannot access GacUI objects, which means they cannot load resources manually.
  - Languages:
    - [ ] JavaScript / TypeScript through Web assembly
    - [ ] .NET (core?) through dll
    - [ ] Python through dll

## GacGen.exe

- Enable linking to external symbols
- In the final pass, only workflow scripts are printed
  - Use WorkflowCompiler.exe to do codegen externally

## GacStudio.exe
