# Goal
* Parsing
    * No need to specify allow ambiguity or not
    * Calculate ambiguous **Parse** cases, pointing out which AST need to support ambiguity
    * Full CFG power, no limitation
    * Be able to assign to any properties (not just enum) in with statement
    * Error message generation
    * Error recovering
* Serializing
    * Escaping and Unescaping pairs (instead of only unescaping)
    * Calculate ambiguous **ToString** cases
    * Generate **ToString** algorithm
* AST
    * Low overhead AST with reflection

# AST Definition (compatible with Workflow)
```
class CLASS_NAME [: BASE_CLASS]
{
  var FIELD_NAME : TYPE;
  ...
}
```

## Configurations
- Include files in generated C++ header
- Depended AST definition files
- Visitors selected to generate
- Optional reflection support

## Types
- `Token`: In the previous version, `Token` is a value type, now it is a reference type.
- `CLASS_NAME`: Another class.
- `TYPE[]`: Array, whose element is not allowed to be another array.

## MISC
- Define a `ToString` algorithm with customizable configurations.

# Lexical Analyzer
- Pair name with regular expressions.
- Extendable tokens.
  - For example, recognize `R"[^\s(]\(` and invoke a callback function to determine the end of the string
- Pair a name with the token subset, and give a default name to a token full set

# Error Messages
- Generate error messages in C++ code

# Syntax Analyzer
- Priority of loops:
  - `+[ RULE ]` means only if `RULE` does not succeed, the result of not having `RULE` is kept.
  - `-[ RULE ]` means only if skipping `RULE` makes the clause not able to parse, the result of having RULE is not discarded.
  - `[ RULE ]` means keep both result
  - `+{ RULE }`, `-{ RULE }`, `{ RULE }` are similar, but `{ RULE }` may generate more than two results, meanwhile others only generate one result.
- Being able to change token subset during parsing.
- Being able to specify a error message when a certain action fails.
- Generate SAX-like parser, with a default handler to create AST.
